## Implementation Recommendations

### Development Approach
- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent services for plugin management, workflow execution, and API gateway
- **API-First Development**: Design and document APIs before implementation
- **Test-Driven Development**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end workflow validation
- **Security by Design**: Threat modeling, regular security reviews, and penetration testing

### Deployment Strategy
- **Multi-Environment**: Development, staging, and production environments with environment parity
- **GitOps Workflow**: Infrastructure and application changes deployed via Git commits
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments with automatic rollback capabilities
- **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region deployment with automated backup and recovery procedures

### Team Structure Recommendation
- **Platform Team (2-3 engineers)**: Core engine, infrastructure, and DevOps
- **Plugin Team (2 engineers)**: Analysis tool integrations and plugin SDK
- **Frontend Team (1 engineer)**: Web interface and user experience
- **Security Engineer (1 engineer)**: Security reviews, threat modeling, compliance
